During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **December 8** to **December 12**, I had a valuable opportunity to learn, practice and apply the knowledge I acquired in the classroom to a professional working environment.

I participated in **deep learning about Amazon Bedrock service and AWS AI ecosystem, as well as many Aws services, thereby significantly improving my skills in **requirements analysis, system architecture thinking and working with technical documents**.

In terms of style, I always try to complete assigned tasks well, comply with AWS's rules and culture, and actively exchange and learn from my **mentor** and friends to improve work efficiency.
