### Main Content

#### Impact of AI on Vietnam's economy

* AI is expected to contribute **120–130 billion USD** (about 25% of GDP) by 2040.
* The current AI market size is **750 million USD**, growing **15–18% per year**.
* Vietnam has about **765 AI startups**, ranked **2nd in ASEAN**.
* Despite its great potential, Vietnam is still in the early stages and needs more investment in infrastructure, human resources, and support policies.

---

#### Evolution Journey: From Generative AI → Agentic AI

* AI technology is moving from **content creation support tools** to **systems capable of independent action**.
* Agentic AI allows multiple agents to coordinate to complete complex tasks.
* The level of automation is increasing, gradually reducing direct human intervention.

---

#### Application of Agentic AI in enterprises

* Increase productivity, reduce repetitive workloads, support innovation.
* By **2028**, **33% of enterprise applications** are forecast to integrate Agentic AI.
* About **15% of daily operational decisions** can be automated.

---

#### Amazon Bedrock – General AI Platform
