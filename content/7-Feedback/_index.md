### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
First Cloud Journey's environment is very professional and inspiring. The workshops are well organized with updated and practical content. The speakers and mentors are all experienced experts, enthusiastic in answering questions

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
Mentor guides very detailedly, explains clearly when I don't understand and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports procedures, documents and creates favorable conditions for me to work smoothly. I appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and handle the problem myself instead of showing me how to do it.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The work I was assigned was consistent with the knowledge I learned at school, and at the same time expanded to new areas that I had never been exposed to. Thanks to that, I not only consolidated my basic knowledge but also learned more practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and how to communicate professionally in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared many practical experiences to help me better orient my career.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still has fun. When there is an urgent project, everyone tries together, supports regardless of position. This helps me feel like I am part of the team, even though I am just an intern.

**6. Internship policy/benefits**
The company supports internship allowances and creates flexible working hours when needed. In addition, being able to participate in internal **events** is a big plus.

### Most satisfying

I am most satisfied with the enthusiastic support from the mentor and the dynamic working environment of the program. The seniors are always ready to answer questions when I encounter difficulties, making me feel more comfortable and confident during the internship. I also appreciate the friendliness and cooperative spirit of everyone, helping me to integrate quickly and work more effectively, and understand more about Aws Cloud services.
